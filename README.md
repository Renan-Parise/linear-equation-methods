# Numerical Methods Repository

This repository contains Python scripts implementing various numerical methods for solving linear algebra problems. These methods are commonly used in scientific computing and engineering disciplines for solving systems of linear equations and performing matrix operations.

## Included Scripts

1. `bisseccao.py`: Implements the bisection method for finding roots of equations.
2. `jacobi.py`: Provides an implementation of the Jacobi iterative method for solving linear systems.
3. `lu.py`: Contains functions for performing LU decomposition of matrices.
4. `pivot.py`: Implements pivot operations for matrix manipulation.
5. `seidel.py`: Implements the Gauss-Seidel iterative method for solving linear systems.
6. `teste.py`: Contains test cases for verifying the correctness and performance of the implemented methods.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently and includes examples or test cases to demonstrate its functionality.
